"In the picture this face is horribly hurt by blows, swollen, with horrible, swollen, and bloody bruises, the eyelids are open, the eyes crossed; the large, open whites have a sort of deathly, glassy shine. But, strangely, when you look at the corpse of this tortured man, a particular and curious question arises: if all his disciples, his chief future apostles, if the women who followed him and stood by the cross, if all those who believed in him and worshipped him had seen a corpse like that (and it was bound to be exactly like that), how could they believe, looking at such a corpse, that this sufferer would resurrect? Here the notion involuntarily occurs to you that if death is so terrible and the laws of nature are so powerful, how can they be overcome? How overcome them, if they were not even defeated now, by the one who defeated nature while he lived, whom nature obeyed, who exclaimed: “Talitha cumi” and the girl arose, “Lazarus, come forth” and the dead man came out?18 Nature appears to the viewer of this painting in the shape of some enormous, implacable, and dumb beast, or, to put it more correctly, much more correctly, strange though it is—in the shape of some huge machine of the most modern construction, which has senselessly seized, crushed, and swallowed up, blankly and unfeelingly, a great and priceless being—such a being as by himself was worth the whole of nature and all its laws, the whole earth, which was perhaps created solely for the appearance of this being alone! The painting seems precisely to express this notion of a dark, insolent, and senselessly eternal power, to which everything is subjected, and it is conveyed to you involuntarily. The people who surrounded the dead man, none of whom is in the painting, must have felt horrible anguish and confusion on that evening, which at once smashed all their hopes and almost their beliefs. They must have gone off in terrible fear, though each carried within himself a tremendous thought that could never be torn out of him. And if this same teacher could have seen his own image on the eve of the execution, would he have gone to the cross and died as he did? That question also comes to you involuntarily as you look at the painting.","The Idiot","Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Richard Pevear (Translator), Larissa Volokhonsky (Translator)","","","","","","","2025-02-25T04:07:31.940063","","509","22","false","false","","","2025-02-25T04:07:31.940063","2025-12-20T09:30:31.080093","2025-12-20T09:30:30.761968","2025-12-20T09:30:30.762453"

"Awakening is the purpose that enfolds all purposes. Whatever we do is meaningful to the extent that it leads to awakening, meaningless to the extent that it leads away from it.

"To meditate on the certainty of death and the uncertainty of its time helps transform the experience of another’s death from an awkward discomfiture into an awesome and tragic conclusion to the transience that lies at the heart of all life.
Over time such meditation penetrates our primary sense of being in the world at all. It helps us value more deeply our relationships with others, whom we come to regard as transient as ourselves. It evokes the poignancy implicit in the transitoriness of all things.","Buddhism without Beliefs","Stephen Batchelor","","Similar to the stoics in the sense that they too meditate on death and its certainty; although they may do it primarily to avoid suffering rather than to achieve a mindful state.","","","","","2024-09-07T00:00:00","","248","8","false","false","","","2024-09-07T00:00:00","2025-12-20T09:30:25.601275","2025-12-20T09:30:23.866758","2025-12-20T09:30:23.867699"

"TRY THIS EXERCISE. Find a quiet, comfortable place. This may be just the corner of a bedroom or study. Then settle into a chair or, if you prefer, sit cross-legged on a cushion on the floor. Make sure your back is unsupported and upright but not tense. Incline your head downward, so your gaze naturally falls about three feet in front of you.
Shut your eyes. Rest your hands in your lap or on your knees. Check to see if there are any points of tension in the body: the shoulders, the neck, around the eyes. Relax them. Become aware of your bodily contact with the ground. Make sure that you are steady and balanced. Notice the subtle polyphony of sounds around you, take note of any sensations in the body, be conscious of your mood of the moment. Don’t judge these things or seek to change them: accept them for what they are.
Take three long, slow, deep breaths. Don’t imagine the breath as some invisible stuff entering and leaving your nostrils; notice the bodily sensations (even the trivial ones like the shifting contact of your skin with your undershirt) that make up the act of breathing[…]","Buddhism without Beliefs","Stephen Batchelor","","","","","","","2024-09-06T00:00:00","","243","8","false","false","","","2024-09-06T00:00:00","2025-12-20T09:30:25.434459","2025-12-20T09:30:23.866758","2025-12-20T09:30:23.867699"

For example, one’s naïveté may result in a tendency towards a “good” response.

2) Eros: modern romantic love  represents the inherent urge within a man towards beauty and truth (comprises but not limited to sexual attraction and sensual pleasure).
3) Philia: friendship or “brotherly love” where the two involved (in the Greek system both must be men) appreciate and respect one another, take pleasure in each other’s company, and explore through discourse philosophic truths. Inspired the expression “Platonic Love”.
4) Storge: This is a fondness or affection for someone that grows through shared values or experiences, in other words, familiarity. It occurs naturally. It is also the natural love that parents feel towards their children.

Subsequently, he links this rationality to ethics and morality and introduces the is/ought problem (Hume). Then he discusses four perspectives on ethics: skepticism, intuitionism, rationalism and empiricism; and notes that stoicism relies on the latter three by adopting a developmental perspective in which we gradually tend to use more rationality and less intuition. Last, the author explains that the ethics of stoicism are tightly related to the community, and how we should train ourselves to treat strangers as our kin.","","","","","2024-01-12T00:00:00","stoicism","468","20","false","true","","","2024-01-12T00:00:00","2025-12-20T09:30:30.400346","2025-12-20T09:30:29.269734","2025-12-20T09:30:29.270098"

Furthermore, it is argued that many real life (social) situations cannot be viewed through a black or white lens; there are often contrasting goals and virtues.

So should it be with persons; if you kiss your child, or brother, or friend… you must remind yourself that you love a mortal, and that nothing that you love is your very own; it is given you for the moment, not for ever nor inseparably, but like a fig or a bunch of grapes at the appointed season of the year, and if you long for it in winter you are a fool.

One thing that we may do is realize the uncertainty in our everyday lives, and ideas that, for instance, we could lose friends, partners, family members to an illness at any given moment.
